# Resume Builder

Designing a resume in Word has always been a frustrating experience, from selecting the right fonts and colors to dealing with formatting issues and more. While there are plenty of online resume builders available, they often come at a cost or include watermarks from the website. As a software engineer, I've decided to develop a user-friendly resume builder application to provide a hassle-free experience for creating resumes.

The app I've developed is primarily targeted towards software engineers and offers a straightforward approach for building resumes. While it may not have an extensive range of features and layouts, it aims to serve as a simple solution. Additionally, this app serves as an opportunity for me to explore various technologies, such as React, React Hook Form, Jotai, and more.
